# Assignment 2 : Improved Webiste

My goal for this assginment was to make everything stand out and occupy it's own space. I felt as though the orginal site, would benefit from a few changes that would make everything stand out more and be digestible to read.

Certain things like the format of the navigation bar already worked well. So I did not make any fundamental changes when it comes to things of that sort. However, I do think the changes I made had a substantial impact on the website user and experience and here's why:

When it came to to nagation bar, I merely changed the background color to go with the flag for Ohio. The attention to detail here was meant highlight what this entire site is about. Alog with that I added a right border to cleary seperate and distinguish the parts of the page. And followed that up with making the navigation elements italiciszed with a text shadow. More over, I placed a border around each image. These changes gave a more sleek look to the website and gave 'design' to something that did not have much of it.

Next, I wanted simply grouped the paragraphs and increased their font size using css grid so that the content can be clearly read and have a space of its own. Lastly, I placed a border around each image.

Some of the changes may be seen as arbitruary and subject, but I do beleive that this made the site much more organized and appealing to look at.
